        You can access the Work Packages ToC diagrams for Section #3 of the Type 1 report using the <b>Go to</b> folder button below. This version of
        the TOC will be included in the final version of your 2024 Type 1 report. <br /><br />
        We recommend using the data and information from the Outcome Indicator Module (available below) to inform the narrative on progress for each
        Work Package over the three-year period (2022â€“2024). This information is particularly useful when drafting content for the Work Package
        progress rating summary table. Please note that the traffic light color is not automatically assigned in this module; it is the
        initiative&apos;s responsibility to determine a color based on targets achieved and overall progress at the Work Package level after three
        years of operations. In the Type 1 report, be sure to provide a rationale for the progress rating assigned to each Work Package.
