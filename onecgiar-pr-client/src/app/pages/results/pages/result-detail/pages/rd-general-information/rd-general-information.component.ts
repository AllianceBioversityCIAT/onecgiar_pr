    <strong>Notes:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Every result should have at least one score of 1 or 2. Results with scores of 0 for all IAs should be rare cases.</li>
    <li>No more than two IAs should receive scores of 2 for a given result. Results with three IAs with scores of 2 should be rare cases.</li>
    <li>Scores should not be assigned solely based on relevance to the collective global targets, but rather to the IA as more broadly defined in the 2030 Strategy and by the IA Platforms, indicated below.</li>
    <li>Scoring should be based on the relevance of the IAs to a given result and not on other criteria such as a specific donorâ€™s level of interest in an IA.</li>
