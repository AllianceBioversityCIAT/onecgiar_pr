# Execution Log — Email one-time-code login for CGIAR center staff outside Active Directory

## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Spec path | `docs/specs/changes/cognito-email-otp-login/` · Module code `OTP` |
| Linked | `requirements.md` (rev 1.1) · `design.md` (rev 2) · `tasks.md` · `judgment.md` · `proposal.md` |
| Approval Mode | pre-approved (standing mandate 2026-09-02) — routine gates logged `auto-approved (pre-approved mode)`; **Cognito toggles, microservice deploys, PROD steps stop for the user** |
| Budget (design §14) | 9 tasks (+1 conditional) · ~1,250 LOC · ≤ 1 Reviewer round per task; tripwire > 12 tasks or > 1,500 LOC |
| Leader | Claude Fable 5.1 (registry T1 row says `opus`; newer session model passes silently) |
| Implementer / Reviewer | `akili-implementer` (`sonnet`) / `akili-reviewer` (`opus`) wrappers; model rotation on 429 per project practice |
| Repositories | PRMS worktree `qa-development-2026` (shared with other sessions — explicit-path commits) · microservice `/Users/jcadavid/Development/one-cgiar-microservices` (`main` checked out; `dev-auth` via a worktree) |
| Started | 2026-09-11 |
| Status | in-progress |

### Pre-flight (2026-09-11)

- `OTP-OQ-6` resolved by the user before execution: the microservice serving Reporting and QA uses `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=6ph57q…` = `general-client`, which already carries `ALLOW_USER_AUTH` → no client-level Cognito change. Docs updated (`requirements.md` §11 + current-state row, `design.md` §1/§4.2, `tasks.md` pre-flight + `OTP-T-1`).
- `OTP-OQ-1` (PROD pool) still open — blocks only the PROD half of `OTP-T-9`.
- No other spec under `docs/specs/` touches `pages/login`, `auth/login` or OTP.
- The microservice checkout has no `auth-microservice/.env`; the spike reads the `general-client` secret at run time through `describe-user-pool-client` (`IBD-DEV`, read-only) into a shell variable — never printed, never saved.
- Eligible now (no dependencies): `OTP-T-1` (read-only export phase; the `EMAIL_OTP` toggle is HITL for the user) and `OTP-T-4` (PRMS server parameter/config). Disjoint files and packages → parallel, width 2.
